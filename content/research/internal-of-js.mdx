# Internals of JavaScript

## Understanding JavaScript Execution Context

Everything in JavaScript happens inside an **Execution Context**.

Every engine that implements ECMAScript — such as:

- **V8** (Chrome, Node.js)
- **JavaScriptCore** (Safari)
- **SpiderMonkey** (Firefox, Deno, Bun, etc.)

...creates and manages execution contexts according to the specification.

> Since the entire JavaScript code runs inside an **Execution Context**, this is the first concept you must understand to grasp how JavaScript works under the hood.

---

## What is an Execution Context?

An **Execution Context** is a construct that wraps around all the code written in a JavaScript file.

When a program starts, a Global Execution Context is created.

It consists of two main components:

1. **Memory Component** (Variable Environment)
2. **Code Component** (Thread of Execution)

---

### 1. Memory Component (Variable Environment)

When an execution context is created, all variables and function declarations are stored in memory as **key-value pairs**:

- Variables are initially set to `undefined`
- Functions are stored with their entire definitions

---

### 2. Code Component (Thread of Execution)

This component is responsible for executing JavaScript code **one line at a time**.

JavaScript is:

- **Single-threaded** — executes one command at a time
- **Synchronous** — executes code line-by-line in the order it appears

## How is the Execution Context Created?

Consider the following example:

```js
var n = 2;
function square(num){
    var ans = num * num;
    return ans;
}
var square2 = square(n);
var sq4 = square(4);
```

This code contains:
- A variable `n`
- A function `square`
- Two variables `square2` and `sq4` to store results

When this script runs, the **Global Execution Context (GEC)** is created. Its lifecycle has two phases:

---

### Phase 1: Memory Allocation

The JavaScript engine scans the code:

- Allocates memory for variables (initially `undefined`)
- Stores function definitions completely

/>

### Phase 2: Code Execution

The engine executes the code **line-by-line**:

#### Step-by-Step Execution

**1.** Executes `var n = 2` → updates memory: `n = 2`

**2.** Skips the `square` function definition (already stored)

**3.** Executes `var square2 = square(n)`:
- A **Function Execution Context (FEC)** is created
- Memory Allocation Phase:
  - `num = undefined`
  - `ans = undefined`
- Code Execution Phase:
  - `num = 2`
  - `ans = 2 * 2 = 4`
  - returns `4` → assigned to `square2`

**4.** Executes `var sq4 = square(4)`:
- Another **FEC** is created
- Memory Allocation Phase:
  - `num = undefined`
  - `ans = undefined`
- Code Execution Phase:
  - `num = 4`
  - `ans = 4 * 4 = 16`
  - returns `16` → assigned to `sq4`

---

## Summary

- JavaScript code runs inside **Execution Contexts**
- Each function call creates a **new execution context**
- Every context has:
  - **Memory Phase** — reserves and initializes memory
  - **Execution Phase** — runs code line-by-line

Understanding Execution Contexts is essential to mastering how JavaScript works internally.
