## 🧠 Understanding JavaScript Execution Context

Everything in JavaScript happens **inside an Execution Context**.

Every engine that implements ECMAScript — like:

- 🧩 **V8** (Chrome, Node.js)
- 🍏 **JavaScriptCore** (Safari)
- 🦊 **SpiderMonkey** (Firefox, Deno, Bun, etc.)

...creates and manages **execution contexts** according to the spec.

> ✅ Since the entire JavaScript code runs inside an **Execution Context**, this is the first concept you must understand to grasp how JavaScript works under the hood.

## 📦 What is an Execution Context?

An **Execution Context** is like a big box that wraps around all the code written in a JS file.

Once the program starts, an execution context is created.

It consists of two main components:

1. **Memory Component** (Variable Environment)
2. **Code Component** (Thread of Execution)

---

### 1. Memory Component (🧠 Variable Environment)

When the execution context is created, all variables and function declarations are stored in memory as **key-value pairs**.

- Variables: set to `undefined`
- Functions: entire definition is stored

---

### 2. Code Component (🧾 Thread of Execution)

This part executes your JavaScript **one line at a time**.

JavaScript is a:

- **Single-threaded** language: executes one command at a time
- **Synchronous** language: executes code line-by-line in order

## 🚀 How is the Execution Context Created?

Let’s take an example:

```js
var n = 2;
function square(num){
    var ans = num * num;
    return ans;
}
var square2 = square(n);
var sq4 = square(4);
```

This code contains:
- A variable `n`
- A function `square`
- Two variables `square2` and `sq4` that store the result of calling `square()`

Once you run this code, the **Global Execution Context (GEC)** is created. This creation happens in **2 phases**:

### 🧮 Phase 1: Memory Allocation

JS engine **scans the entire code**:

- Allocates memory to variables (set to `undefined`)
- Stores function definitions completely

### ⚙️ Phase 2: Code Execution

Now JS engine executes the code **line by line**:

#### 🪜 Step-by-step Execution:

**1.** Executes `var n = 2` → updates memory to `n = 2`

**2.** Skips the function definition line (already stored)

**3.** Hits `var square2 = square(n)` → function is invoked:

- A new **Function Execution Context (FEC)** is created
- It also goes through:
  - Memory Allocation Phase:
    - `num = undefined`
    - `ans = undefined`
  - Code Execution Phase:
    - `num = 2`
    - `ans = 2 * 2 = 4`
    - returns `4` → stored as `square2 = 4`

**4.** Executes `var sq4 = square(4)` → similar process:

- New **FEC** created
- Memory Allocation Phase:
  - `num = undefined`
  - `ans = undefined`
- Code Execution Phase:
  - `num = 4`
  - `ans = 4 * 4 = 16`
  - returns `16` → stored as `sq4 = 16`

---

## 🧩 Summary

- JavaScript runs inside **Execution Contexts**.
- Every function call creates a **new execution context**.
- Each context has:
  - **Memory Phase**: reserves and initializes memory
  - **Execution Phase**: runs the code line-by-line

Understanding this is essential to mastering **how JavaScript works internally**.
